Project 2 - Eventix


Overview:

Eventix is an web application that allows users to host events and attend events. The aim of this project is to increase one's social network by attending various events and meeting people of similar mindset or interests. 

Features:

Eventix has a main page that showcase the various events hosted by different individuals and features functions such as account registration, account log in, attending events and hosting events. In addition, each user will have a dedicated dashboard to feature events that they are attending and events that they are hosting.

The web application utilises Express as a framework to create server side for the application, and React for server side rendering to render the markup from server side.

postgresSQL is the choice for my relational database management system as it is object-relational and suitable for working with Express and React.
